    "This case study focuses on the Bellabeat app. We will utilize the data found on these smart devices to recommend next business moves for Bellabeat for continued growth.\n",
    "___\n",
    "## <span style = \"color:#1d60aa;\">**1. Ask Phase**</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Business Task**\n",
    "Utilize key data in order to make informed decisions to help Bellabeat continue to grow through marketing. *FIX*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key stakeholders:**\n",
    "* Urška Sršen - Bellabeat cofounder and Chief Creative Officer\n",
    "* Sando Mur - Mathematician and Bellabeat cofounder; key member of executive team\n",

    "#### **Data Sources**\n",
    "The data sources used in this case study is from the FitBit Fitness Tracker Dataset. This dataset is found on Kaggle.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Data Integrity**\n",
    "This data set contains different metrics from a group of 30 individual users. We have no information on these users, such as age or race, so the data may be biased towards a certain group of people.\n",
    "___\n",
    "## <span style = \"color:#1d60aa;\">**3. Process Phase**</span>\n",
    "For this case study, I decided to use R. R allows me to create tables and visualizations all in one place for easy access to share with stakeholders.\n",
    "#### **Installing Packages**\n",
    "For this analysis, I used the tidyverse and ggplot2 packages. The main packages that are used include:\n",
    " - add later \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "library(tidyverse)\n",
    "library(ggplot2)\n",

    "#### **Importing Datasets**\n",
    "There are many files included in this dataset, however, the only datasets needed to complete our business task include:\n",

    "#### **Cleaning Datasets**\n",
    "In order to confirm we have the accuruate number of entries, we can figure out how many unique IDs apply for each dataset.\n",

    "33\n",
    "33\n",
    "24\n",
    "```\n",
    "This tells me that each dataset has 33 unique IDs, except for sleep_day which has only 24. Missing unique IDs in sleep_day makes our analysis less accurate, but it will have to do for now.\n",

    "Finally, in order to merge the datasets daily_activity and sleep_day, we need to make sure the dates are consistent. To change them into the same formats:\n",
